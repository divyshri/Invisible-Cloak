# Invisible-Cloak

How it works
This technique is opposite to the Green Screening. In green screening, we remove background but here we will remove the foreground frame.
Capture and store the background frame
Detect the defined color using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
Segment out the defined colored part by generating a mask.
Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.



Once you run the code wait for a few seconds, let the webcam capture the background image then you can come inside the frame with your magical Cloak and be invisible.
